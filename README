NAU Ski and Snowboard Webpage

My first webpage made for a ski and snowboard club at Northern Arizona University. Includes a home page, 
events page that lists the club's future events, and an about page that includes the club info,
members, and contact info.

Events can be added to the database using a form on a separate form page and they can be deleted on a
separate delete page. Events are displayed after adding them through a form.

Webpage made using:
Front-End - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery
Back-End - NodeJS, NPM, ExpressJS
Database - noSQL MongoDB
Developed on Cloud9 IDE and used git for version control.
Hosted on Heroku.
